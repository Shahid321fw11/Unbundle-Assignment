## Approach
### 1. Library Selection
For creating the product carousel, I chose to use the [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) third-party library. Flickity is a robust and well-documented library that provides a wide range of carousel customization options. I preferred to use this library to save development time and ensure a smooth and feature-rich user experience.

- Create an HTML structure for the carousel and add appropriate classes and IDs.
- Initialize Flickity with the desired configuration options.

### 3. Customization
To implement the specific requirements of automatic rotation, unlimited scroll, and draggable functionality, you can refer to the [Flickity documentation](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/). Flickity provides options and methods to control these behaviors.

### 4. Responsiveness
Flickity is designed to be responsive out of the box. It automatically adapts to various screen sizes and devices. Ensure that your HTML structure and CSS styles do not interfere with this responsiveness.

### 5. Styling
Customized the appearance of product carousel by modifying the CSS. I define styles for carousel cells, navigation buttons, and other elements to match your design requirements.

## Conclusion
By using the Flickity library and adding autoplay, unlimited scroll, and draggable features, you can create a dynamic and visually appealing product carousel for your website's homepage. This approach simplifies development and provides a user-friendly experience across different devices.
